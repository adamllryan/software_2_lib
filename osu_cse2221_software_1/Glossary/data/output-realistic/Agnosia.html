<p>The state in which an individual is unable to identify or recognize persons, objects, shapes, sounds or smells is called <a href="Agnosia.html">agnosia</a>. The condition is however, not associated with memory loss or any kind of impairment of sensory organs. It is a neurological disorder which results from damage to the occipitotemporal border, a part of the ventral stream.</p>
