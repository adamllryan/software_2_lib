<p><a href="Weapon Focus.html">Weapon focus</a> is a factor affecting the reliability of the testimony of an eyewitness, because the <a href="Attention.html">attention</a> of the witness, present at the crime scene, is focused on the weapon the criminal is holding, which makes him ignore other aspects of the crime scene and eventually leads to memory impairments when he tries to recollect the crime scene details.</p>
