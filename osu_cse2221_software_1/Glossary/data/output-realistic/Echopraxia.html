<p>The state or condition in which a person involuntarily imitates or repeats the movements of others is termed as <a href="Echopraxia.html">echopraxia</a>. <a href="Echopraxia.html">Echopraxia</a> is a behavioral phenomenon and thus, it is different from what is considered to be ‘tic’. The sudden, non-rhythmic, repetitive vocalization or motor movements (throat clearing, eye blinking, toe crunching, etc.) are known as tics.</p>
