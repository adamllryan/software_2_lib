	<div class="item">Here is a paragraph, I am not sure what to
		write about, so I'll just write about this page. I used two grid
		containers above and below this paragraph to organize each of the
		sections, using some css to add padding and arrange the grid boxes in
		a 1x3. There is a little padding, but not much. There are two lists,
		one listing the items used on the page , the other containing an
		"about me" section. I have a link to github and two images, one is the
		OSU logo and the other is the first thing I saw on my phone. I tried
		to figure out how to align certain items in the center, but most
		methods would be way too complicated and/or mess up the borders.<br>
		
		EDIT: I wrote this in an online compiler since Eclipse wasn't really 
		cooperating, and when I copied it back I had trouble getting the style
		to work. I'm not sure why it won't work in Eclipse but the grid system
		no longer works and I can't use style tags without being flagged as 
		invalid. Also</div>
