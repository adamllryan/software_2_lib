Concerns: in create_key, I tried to use a different structure for the loop but it would seg fault. I can't tell why it did because it was all set up correctly, but I structured it differently and then it worked. 
Also, in the rotate functions, using .section causes compilation errors and I am not sure why. makes the gcc report Error: missing name
GDB in C: I used gdb to print out multiple tests of create_key working
GDB in Assembler: Used gdb to trace through create_key to figure out why getchar was not exiting on \n. 
Yeah. 


i spent like 3 hours trying to find out why rotate_left was not found and i just found out that named rotate_left rotate_right in rotate_left.s
