2. I do not feel 100% confident with pointers yet, while it works it does not feel completely correct. I really dislike this 10 line max
system because every time I hit 10 lines, I need to create a new method in the lab3.h file and make sure it matches where it is called and 
the new file where it is implemented. I understand the reasoning but it's very tedious to ensure consistency in 3 different places when it
would make more sense to have it all in 1 function. 
I am very confused about this one thing in save_info. I couldn't figure out a way to pass a char[256] as a parameter and I couldn't pass it
as a char* because now it has no value, so I was stuck with an 11 line function. treating it as uninitialized char* would cause the
thispizza pointer to be overwritten and create a seg fault, so I just gave up. 
3. Used GDB to solve issues with thispizza pointer and segfaults with writing to file. Mainly put breakpoints at and around save_info()
so I could trace through it and use disp to view values. I forgot about parameter pass by values so it took me a few hours to figure out
why thispizza was empty. I ran through it with gdb a bunch of times but it didn't occur to me that thispizza only having one value meant
that it wasn't writing to the passed pointer (it was able to print out fine before I moved everything into its own function).
